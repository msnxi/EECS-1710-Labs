Lab 1: This code takes what we learned and adds my own part to it. I created a rectangle as big as the screen that is black and has the opacity of 5 so it adds fade affect to the circle. Also when the screen is filled up and the user wants to reset, all they have to do is press a key and it will go back to being a blank purple screen. This is an improvement from the lectures because it is aesthetically pleasing and also gives the user the ability to restart if they wanna try a different way of using the circles.
